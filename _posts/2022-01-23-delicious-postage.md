# Delicious Postage

I have a made a New Year's resolution. I just made it today, but it is not a late New Year's resolution. It is an early Lunar New Year's resolution. 新年快乐！
I have resolved to lower my inhibitions about writing things in public by treating my blog more like a del.icio.us collection of links.

Do you remember delicio.us? To be honest, I barely do. But somehow it was going to usher in a golden age of an open internet that made orderly sense, with the best stuff on top,
by everyone sharing their bookmarks and hash-tagging them. As you may have noticed, that didn't happen.

The dream lives on though. If we can figure this thing out before the tech monopolies capture all the commons or crypto burns up the planet, we may still find an internet utopia.

I don't know how to do that, but I do know how to read the internet. 
The things that I read and post about here are not necessarily things I agree with, just things that I am reading/watching/listening to.
