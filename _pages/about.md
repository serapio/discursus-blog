An Epic Preamble
-----

In the remote forgotten past,  
when world-wide-web standards were young,  
and the cyber-tubes were still cooling,  
idealists proclaimed that:

> "Information wants to be free"

and connection would bring us together.  
Personal websites would give every person a voice,  
friend-of-a-friend files would establish trust,  
syndication feeds would distribute the blessings,  
and the world would live as one.  

That age expired before its dawning.  
Voices were captured in walled gardens,  
while the words of the profits are written  
out for copypasta stenciled in every margin,  
and chasing each of us across the pages.  

> *Disinformation* wants to be free and ad-supported

But some who remember the old order,  
continued to practice the way of truth.
