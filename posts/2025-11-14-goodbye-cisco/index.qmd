This week I turned in my Cisco badge after 8.5 years there with the MindMeld team, on top of 2 years with MindMeld, Inc before we were acquired by Cisco. Through more than a decade with the same team, in many ways it changed every year.

This was my first job out of grad school, and when I started, I could offer very little evidence that I could do anything very practical as a "Search Quality Engineer" at an "intelligent voice interfaces" startup.[^1] I had no engineering degree, I hadn't taken a computer science course in over a decade, and I had been in grad school since the year I got my first mobile phone. I had a masters thesis I never finished, and a PhD dissertation that I had not defended yet. I had never shared a git repo with anyone, and I didn't know what a JSON format was.

[^1]: This was before we were calling everything "AI" – the puffery was about "intelligent", "smart" and "machine learning", and there was just one mention of "AI" on [the website in those days](https://web.archive.org/web/20150323122330/https://www.expectlabs.com/).

For some reason they let me join, and then over the next 2 years, while the team grew, everyone who had interviewed me – except for the CEO – left. We pivoted from a platform strategy to a library strategy, and the work scaled up to a series of big projects. I was the key engineer on a project that brought in over a million dollars in revenue, and I was pulled into a few projects to troubleshoot ranking or entity recognition quality, or to design and curate the training and test data. At the time of the acquisition, I was responsible for maintaining and improving the quality of a food & drink ordering application that had many real users and a menu that rotated every three months.

The first couple years after joining Cisco, we focused on building a voice interface for conference room devices. I designed and ran an evaluation of ASR providers, and working across business units, I established the process for collecting in situ wake word audio recordings that were used to bootstrap training of the keyword detection models or to evaluate them. I then moved onto the sub-project that worked out how to find people named in spoken commands (which led to a patent), and then focused on making intent recognition very reliable. For the next few years, I served as a people leader of the "Interaction Quality" team, a small team of data scientists and linguists responsible for data development, system evaluation, and product metrics, for the voice interface that the MindMeld and room device teams had built. We expanded the system from just English to support seven languages, working with a couple linguists for each language. For years I had joked that my work didn't involve any linguistics, just patterns of thought that are similar to linguistics, but for this internationalization work, it genuinely required anticipating how structural or pragmatic differences across languages would affect how the processing or data would need to be adapted to maintain high quality application behavior. In the last few years, I stepped back from people leadership, and I acted as a technical advisor, researcher and data scientist, as we worked out how to build and evaluate a variety of LLM-based features. That included internationalization and evaluation of features that are used by millions of people.

I enjoyed the challenges of research and the satisfaction of delivering applications that many people found useful, but to me what was most fulfilling was collaborating with my teammates, learning and building *together*. There was a close camaraderie forged during the startup years, and much of that get-it-done collaborative character has persisted even while people have come and gone. I will miss the team I left behind, just as I miss all of those over the years who left before me.
