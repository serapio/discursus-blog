You need your data to be ecologically valid, comparable to data in the wild. And you need your metrics to be closely aligned with product objectives. If your system has already been unleashed in the wild, your bottom turtle might even be field testing or live metrics from regular usage. But for the sake of the privacy and safety of your users, you probably can’t or shouldn’t measure live usage in as much detail as you can in offline testing. And you probably shouldn’t depend on users to explore your system’s worst behavior. But whatever data sources you have available, your foundational evaluations should be carefully informative of what your system is doing in the wild, and carefully aligned with product goals."

A spam filter can block new kinds of spam that were not available for training, just by generalizing from simplistic representations of email. And fundamentally, LLMs start their development evaluating predictions of the next few characters in text corpora that might or might not contain examples of the genre of text that your system is generating.\n\n\n\nA turtle on a turtle pile, evaluating his life choices (photo CC-BY 2.0 Marco Verch)"

As in these pictures, each turtle should be a little closer to the foundation than the one above it. Principles that I will write about later go into more depth about what this means in practice, but at a high level it means that the academic data folds of train/test splits or conventional train/dev/test splits really break out into multiple datasets with multiple splits and disaggregation dimensions.\n\n\n\nTwo turtle piles (photo CC-BY-ND-2.0 Nick Harris)\n\n\nIt is true that LLMs add a bit more complexity here, where it’s not a single stack.

We’ve gotten about half way through the book, but as the vocabulary and grammar get more difficult, I’m finding the need to slow down. The language is a Western Tucanoan language, indigenous to the upper Caquetá river valley in Colombia, on the edge of the Amazon basin. There are a couple closely related languages in the upper Caquetá region and the neighboring corner of Ecuador, and all other languages that are known to be related to it have home territories to the east, mostly in the Vaupés. But to me it feels familiarly like an Otomanguean language. There are suprasegmental nasalization, glottalization and tone that reminds me of Mixtec, though the tone system only has high and low, without contours. And a few common words are similar enough to trip me up sometimes:\n\n\n\nKoreguaje\nMixtec\nEnglish\n\n\n\n\nvʉ’e [wɨʔe]\nve’e [βeʔe]\nhouse\n\n\nchʉ’ʉ [tʃɨʔɨ]\nyu’u [ʒuʔu]\nme\n\n\njʉ̃jʉ̃ [hɨ̃hɨ̃]\njãjã [xãxã]\nyes\n\n\n\nBut if you look at larger lists of comparative vocabulary, for Otomanguean and Tucanoan, there are no such similarities. It seems that these few are coincidentally similar words, in similar sound systems."

It was also in 1919 that the 18th amendment was ratified, prohibiting the production and sale of alcohol. The prohibition of alcohol lead to a marked increase in corruption and mafia influence in Los Angeles. The recognition of women’s right to vote, as momentous as it was, had smaller influence, at least initially."

For the “public welfare”, swimming pools were designated for whites only except for one day a week, called “colored day” or “international day”. Activist Betty Hill (pictured on left) was affiliated with the NAACP but carried out most of her activism through her neighborhood association and a group she started, called the Republican Women’s Study Club. Immediately after the decision was made to segregate the swimming pools and for the next five years, Betty Hill led a series of boycotts and lawsuits to push the city to reverse the decision. Initial judicial rulings allowed the segregation on “separate but equal” grounds, because there was one swimming pool in the city that allowed children of all races throughout the week. Finally in 1931, a judge ruled that the city had to integrate the swimming pools. Three times the city council voted on whether to contest the ruling, twice while Winfred was in office and once after he left. Each time, the city narrowly declined to contest the ruling. I don’t know how Winfred voted, and it was not a significant issue in that election. Similar practices of “Mexican Mondays” at public pools were known elsewhere in California, as late as 1944 in San Bernardino."

The children of my grandmothers’ generation–who were taught that it was a health risk to swim with Black kids and that Mexican American kids belong in Mexico, and shouldn’t marry each other–overcame enormous obstacles and their own prejudices to create the good old days of my generation’s childhood.\nThe arc of history that “bends towards justice” is loooong, and doesn’t bend on its own. People bend it.\nThe smart and nice people we often admire, who take centrist views on the issues of the day, are essential for a civil society, but they won’t be the leaders who bend history towards justice. Though they may well be the deciding vote when the tide changes.\nIf you, like me, are one of those people who like civil society, take a good hard look at what your positions will look like in 50 or 100 years. Use the influence you have to make history step lively towards justice.\nThe current levels of polarization and inequality are serious problems, but they can be fixed. We need to remind each other that we are on one team against the forces that threaten to destroy human society, find common ground, and work together like we are fighting a war–not with each other, but with poverty, climate change, dehumanization, etc.\nElections matter, but they are just the beginning. If you don’t like your options, make your favorite options happen. If you do like your options, don’t count on your heroes to do the right thing. They are human too, and may need some prodding from time to time.\nThis epidemic will pass. Eventually enough of us will be doing some combination of masking+distancing+testing+tracing that the uncontrolled spread will be stopped. Let’s get there ASAP, and don’t let racism and classism compound the problem. We are literally all in this together."

    "text": "This is a PSA for folks with an audio corpus of a low resource language: it is getting possible to build a decent speech recognition system with remarkably little transcribed data. Take this into account next time you are discussing acceptable use of new recordings, and double check how community members feel about these possibilities.\n\n\n\nReference and predicted text sample\n\n\nOver the past couple weekends I participated in an effort to “finetune” speech recognition models for each of the ~60 languages in the Common Voice dataset. I focused on Luganda because the languages I know more about either are not in the dataset or were well-covered by other participants. Using about 6 hours of read speech for training (i.e. people read sentences from public domain documents, and no separate text data was used for a language model), the resulting model reaches 23% word-error-rate, and considering that Bantu words are relatively long, this means it’s potentially useful for jump-starting transcription work, indexing an untranscribed audio corpus, or enabling a voice interface. It’s likely that an even lower error rate is possible using audio data from a related language for initial training, or using text data to guide the output."

    "text": "In California, more than 1 out of 4 residents were born in another country. In the San Francisco Bay Area, that number is about 1 in 3, and among tech workers in the area, about 3 out of 4. So in tech circles, dominated by Silicon Valley, English is treated as the majority and default language, and much exposure to languages beyond English positions those other languages as foreign, personal, or home languages. Even as home languages, they are losing ground to English, replaced by the second or third generation. Someone who works in Silicon Valley, USA might easily think that English overwhelmingly dominates the business world, and that people who don’t use English in business life are switching to it.\nIt’s certainly true that English does have a dominant position in the global economy and in the technology world. It is spoken as the most common home language and as a national language in three of the G7 countries, and it is used as the primary trade language among speakers of many other languages. In language technology, especially in NLP research, English is often treated as unspoken default. However, the dominance of English should not be exaggerated. English accounts for a minority of the global economy, a minority of technology users, and a minority of internet content. Moreover, the dominance of English is declining."

Even though English is the language accounting for the most nominal GDP, it is approximately the same sum as the next three languages combined (Chinese, Japanese and German), and the top 10 languages here account for less than 80% of the global GDP."

However, the methodology used there assigns a language according to the default of the top-level page, ignoring subdomains, so any multilingual website that sets English as the default language will count for English in the results.

In addition, as digital infrastructure development extends the reach of smartphones, and of the internet more generally, the pool of technology users continues to diversify.\n\n\n\nGlobal GDP by region 2010 to 2019\n\n\nAll of this means that if you are on a research team investigating language technology or on a product team developing a language-dependent system, you really need to keep a global perspective and consider multiple languages in your plan. Otherwise you will either be limiting your impact to a small portion of your potential users or very poorly serving those users.\nFortunately, the cost of localized language technology is quickly falling, making it feasible to support more languages. But that is a topic for another post."
